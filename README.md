Scripts for installing different tools or systems that are generally required for developing large-scale data analytics systems


- **For non-root users**: The scripts are written primarily for use at a shared cluster in the university lab, where we do not have the root priviledge. *It is suggested to use package managers of your OS if you have the root priviledge, instead of installing a copy at the user level.*
- Precaution: compatibility issues among systems across different scripts are not checked (while systems installed within one script are supposed to work together). Use at your own risk.
